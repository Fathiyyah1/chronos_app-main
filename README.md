# Chronos is a Personal Financial Assistant App

A new Flutter project uses Alibaba Cloud and machine learning to help individuals track their expenses, manage their money, and develop their credit scores. Our application is integrated with credit information companies such as SIMAH; This allows the individual to register with their account and see their credit score, credit history, and any external debts. The app provides users with personalized and interactive financial advice, helping them achieve their financial goals, reduce their expenses, and improve their credit scores. Users can now set up reminders for payments and bills to be paid, and use machine learning to predict credit scores based on the user's spending pattern and financial behavior. Kronos has become a one-stop shop for personal finance management, helping users make better credit decisions and achieve their financial goals.
